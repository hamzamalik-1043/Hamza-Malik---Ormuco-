Question A --
Code made using C++ (on MS Virtual Studio) The Code asks for the user to input line lengths for the two lines. The code runs the inputted line lengths through multiple loops (if/else if/else) to check for overlap. If the program outputs a message to the user whether or not it found any overlap on the lines.

Question B --
Code made using C++ (on MS Virtual Studio) Code is missing any use of a software library, Instead simply asks for the user to input 2 numbers. Loops check which number is greater or less than the other or if they are equal. Outputs the text after indentifying which result is true for the numbers.

Question C --
Code made using C++. Implemented a cache (lru built in) by creating a cache object thats then utilized by the main function. In order to implement this in the stack, any api will need to be developed to communicate with the cache object. The api will also need to be hosted on a cloud service along side the class, where the service offers geo distribuition, minimal latency, and in almost real time.
