Question A
Code made using C++ (on MS Virtual Studio) The Code asks for the user to input line lengths for the two lines. The code runs the inputted line lengths through multiple loops (if/else if/else) to check for overlap. If the program outputs a message to the user whether or not it found any overlap on the lines.

Question B
Code made using C++ (on MS Virtual Studio) Code is missing any use of a software library, Instead simply asks for the user to input 2 numbers. Loops check which number is greater or less than the other or if they are equal. Outputs the text after indentifying which result is true for the numbers.

Question C
Code made using C++. Implemented a cache by creating a cache object thats then utilized by the main function. In order to implement this in the stack, any api will need to be developed to communicate with the cache object.
